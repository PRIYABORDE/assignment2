        Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites.
         It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.
        It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.

      <br />

      Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and 
      back-end development. Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or 
      application, including the design, layout, and user interface. This involves working with 
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.
