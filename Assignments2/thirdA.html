      A website is a collection of many web pages.<br>

      web pages are digital files that are written using HTML(HyperText Markup Language). <br>

      To make your website available to every person in the world,<br>

       it must be stored or hosted on a computer connected to the Internet round a clock.<br>

       Such computers are known as a Web Server.
       <br>
        The website's web pages are linked with hyperlinks and hypertext and share a common interface and design.<br>

         The website might also contain some additional documents and files such as images, videos, or <br>
         other digital assets.
